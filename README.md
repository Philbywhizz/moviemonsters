# MovieMonsters

___"Simcity meets Godzilla"___

A b-grade monster movie game written in the [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

A game set in the early days of movies and cinema - where cheesy B-grade horror and disaster movies ruled.

This particular movie is about a monster and a city, however instead of playing the _good guy_, you get to play the monster.

How would you play your monster? Do you cause lots of destruction and chaos, or are you just wanting a bite to eat? It isn't going to be easy to make friends when you have the whole city against you!
