# Project Scope

To keep things into perspective, the scope document will keep each version of development defined.

## Version 0.1.0 - the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP will simply test out the game mechanics and playability. Lets keep it simple. It will be limited to just following:

### Limitations:

- A single defined monster (player), with a simple single attack (touch) and basic movement (fwd, back, turn left, turn right)
- A single actor type that can either runs away when the monster is spotted, or will be aggressive that attacks when monster is sighted.
- Props just consist of 1 type (bullets).
- Sets are just a single item which cannot be seen through and is destructible (building).
- No vehicles.
- No aircraft.
- No default game theme, end condition or score keeping.
- A single 'city' set for testing the interaction of entities.
- No graphics, all text based.
- Basic UI structures with simple elements (text based).

### Gameplay scenario conditions and setup:

- A single stage that fills up the whole screen.
- A single monster controlled by the player.
- A single actors with 2 modes.
	- One that that runs away (citizen).
	- One that can attack the monster (police/army).
- Items acting as a set (buildings) that obscures vision.
	- Can be damaged and/or destroyed when attacked.
